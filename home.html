<h1>Welcome to the http test server</h1>

<p>You can use it to test your https servers requests, just hit this service and it will respond with some of your request parameters<p>
    <p>For example, that request was received at {{.Time}}</p>
    <p>Currently we have 3 endpoints, <a href="/headers">/headers</a> and <a href="body">/body</a> that will print the headers and body from your request in JSON format</p>
    <p>And <a href="/all">/all</a> that will print some general info, as well as Headers and Body</p>
    <p>I hope you can find it useful!</p>
